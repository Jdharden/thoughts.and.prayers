About this story

The Twitter analysis of the expression "thoughts and prayers" is based on a review of more than 615,000 tweets collected 72 hours after 15 mass shootings since 2012. The shootings include attacks at Cinemark Century 16 Theater in Aurora, Sandy Hook Elementary School, Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, a protest in Dallas, First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas and at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.

More than one million tweets in English were collected before reducing the number to just over 615,000. The tweets were cleaned by removing illegible tweets. Retweets and links to news stories were also excluded to remove any possible outliers in the analysis and overs aturation of repeating headlines. The tweets were then classified as genuine or critical. Genuine tweets were posts deemed to express sentiment such as sympathy, while the sentiment of the critical posts suggested that "thoughts and prayers are not enough."

The grouping of the tweets was performed by using a text analysis on each tweet, creating a lexicon of sequences of words and phrases. Each phrase and sequence in the lexicon was then deemed either genuine or critical. The Post then calculated which percentage of tweets were genuine thoughts of prayers and which ones were not. 

A quality check of the data was manually performed to identify a margin of error. 

The margin of error ranged between 3 and 5% for each shooting analyzed.
